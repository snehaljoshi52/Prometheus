Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit designed primarily for reliability and scalability. 
It was originally developed by SoundCloud and has since become a part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).


# Key Features of Prometheus :- 
--------------------------
                            1] Time-Series Data Storage: 
                                                       >> Prometheus stores all data as time-series, meaning it stores a sequence of 
                                                          timestamped values belonging to the same metric.

                            2] Powerful Query Language (PromQL): 
                                                        >> Prometheus comes with a flexible query language called PromQL, which allows users 
                                                           to select and aggregate time-series data in real-time.

                            3] Multi-Dimensional Data Model :
                                                             >> Prometheus uses a dimensional data model with time-series data identified by metric names and key/value pairs called labels. 
                                                                This allows for more granular monitoring and querying.

                            4] Service Discovery : 
                                                    >> Prometheus can dynamically discover the services it should scrape using built-in service discovery or by specifying static configurations.

                            5] Alerting : 
                                          >> Prometheus has a built-in alerting mechanism.

                                          >>  It can trigger alerts based on the queries defined in Prometheus, which can then be routed to various notification channels like email, Slack, 
                                              or PagerDuty through Alertmanager, a companion component.

                            6] Visualization : 

                                          >> Prometheus integrates well with Grafana, a popular visualization tool, allowing users to create dashboards for visualizing 
                                             the collected metrics.



# USE Cases :- 
                            1] Infrastructure Monitoring :

                                                        >> Track the performance and availability of servers, databases, and other infrastructure components.

                            2] Application Monitoring :

                                                        >> Monitor the performance, resource utilization, and health of applications.

                            3] Alerting : 
 
                                                       >> Set up alerts for issues like high CPU usage, memory leaks, or service downtime.



                # Prometheus is widely used in cloud-native environments and is a key component of many Kubernetes monitoring stacks.
